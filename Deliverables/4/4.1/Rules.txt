STEPS TO PLAY BACKGAMMON:

1. Setup board
2. Roll one die to determine who goes first
3. Each player moves
    a. Roll two die
    b. Select the first checker to move; if there are any checkers on the board, it must be one of these
    c. Given the selected checker's position, and each die's roll value, determine whether or not a move can be made
    d. Visually indicate the moves available to this player's selected checker and their corresponding die roll
    e. If no moves are available for the given checker, repeat steps 3b-3d until possible
    f. If no moves are available for any checker, the given player forfeits their turn
    g. Otherwise, repeat steps 3b-3f for the second selected checker

Things to check:
    1. If a dice roll of two die are given, both values are different; if a roll of four die are given, all values are
    the same.
    2. Unless two die of the same value are rolled, a turn can only contain up to 2 cpos pairs; otherwise, it may contain
    up to 4 cpos pairs.
    3. That a move begins at a position with at least one checker of the given color
    4. That a move ends at a position with no more than one checker of the other color
    5. That a move begins and ends at positions with a difference no greater than 6
    6. That a turn is comprised of moves from the board for as long as there is at least one checker of the given color
    on the board
